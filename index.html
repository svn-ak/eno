        <h2>So you're 19...</h2>

        <h3>A Little Note for You</h3>
        
        <p class="letter">
            You thought the cards were the only gift? I wanted to make something a little more permanent, a place to remind you just how amazing you are. 
        </p>
        <p class="letter">
            19 is a weird age I must say, take this from a person who's living moribundly, the last of few months of 19, with one foot in the grave waving sayonara to my teens (~unc status is at my door posing as the grim reaper, he says ive achieved what im destined to and people are waiting for me outside - i peek outside to see smiling rats in formal attire squeaking "congratulations are in order! welcome buddy, 40 more years and you're set for life!"~). 
        </p>
        <p class="letter">
            anyway, coming back to the point of being 19 - you'll cry, a lot, you'll laugh more, a 100x more. as time passes, and you figure shit out (or don't) it really doesn't matter trust me,, because when the moon is above our heads, and the lights are out in your dorm (hopefully your roomie doesnt fucking turn them back on), and you're all alone, without your family, friends, or me.
        </p>
        <p class="letter">
            you should FEEL. confused much? 
        </p>
        <p class="letter">
            yes, FEEL. be it any emotion, be it reflection, be it introspection, be it about a person/place you miss. because i was scared too, going into the last year of my teenage, there have been so many nights when im alone by myself, ive absolutely bawled, in silence thinking of what will be or not be. 
        </p>
        <p class="letter">
            over the last few years, what ive learned is, it is an absolute privelige - to feel, to care this much at this age. for we go into a slumber only because a part of us knows, everything will be okay and there will be a fix, however big our problem is, we wake up.
        </p>
        <p class="letter">
            knowing there's life ahead of us, so much to do, so much to explore, so much to learn. (~i remember my biggest fear in 2012 was losing my mom in a public place, i cried for hours, just thinking of it~) 
        </p>
        <p class="letter">
            my point from this yap session being - endri, we're not perfect, and i dont think so we ever will be, not to ourselves, with our ever so high expectations from self (i guess ive heavily related on that, im glad i found you). 
        </p>
        <p class="letter">
            forget being with me for a second. with the upcoming year, 19 for you and 20 for me, on a human level, what i want for the both of us, is to learn to ACTUALLY learn to love ourselves. (if that makes any sense)
        </p>
        <p class="letter">
            welllllllllllll, so while we're young dumb broke high school kids, lets make mistakes, lets absolutely NOT learn from them and make more mistakes, because we can,,, because we'll forgive ourselves,,, because we're kids,,, just because. (~the chef (me) strongly recommends a pinch of salt with this dish (whatever ive cooked here)~)
        </p>
        <p class="letter">
            on a serious note, i genuinely, dont know what becomes of us 10, 20, 30 years down the line from today. if we're together, if we're not, if we fell apart, if life got in the way, or if, in the end, it all worked out.
        </p>
        <p class="letter">
            let this website serve as a testament, for your being, this is irrefutable proof of your existence, that endri agrawal, eno, YOU are loved. in this moment.
        </p>
        <p class="letter">
            ~come back here when everything is falling apart in life. because in this website, lies love for you, the type which transcends time.~
        </p>
